# SmartCare-WebApplication

a web-based system aims to replace the paper-based system of SmartCare Surgery, a GP business, with a web-based system accessible to doctors, nurses, and patients. The system facilitates appointment booking, consultation management, invoicing, and administrative tasks.

SmartCare Surgery is recruiting 1 full-time doctor, 1 part-time doctor, and 1 part-time nurse. The working scheme requires 1 doctor and 1 nurse to serve every Monday and Friday, while 2 doctors serve the rest of the week. The system serves both NHS and private patients, with charges based on consultation length. The system is expected to have separate functionalities for doctors, nurses, patients, and an admin user. Key functionalities include appointment booking, consultation management, invoicing, and reporting.

The web application is expected to meet the following requirements:

Include main pages for selecting user type and actions, login/registration, dashboards for doctors, nurses, patients, and admins. Smooth navigation between pages and secure access to user dashboards. Integration with external services for calendar and address lookup. Separate deployment of the database system using Docker containers. Use of Python Django, a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), Docker containers, and Django Restful Framework (DRF). Technologies Used Python Django Database system (PostgreSQL in our case) Docker Django Restful Framework (DRF)
